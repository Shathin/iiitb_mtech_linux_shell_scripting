- **Answer** - A short description about the script.  
- **Code block 1** - The code editor - Shows the script's code.  
- **Code block 2** - The terminal - Shows the output(s) of the script.

---

# Question 1

**[Question]** Write a shell script to count the number of block device files in `/dev`Â directory.Â 

**[Answer]** The shell script `1-counting-block-files.sh` uses three commands - `ls`, `grep` and `wc` to count the number of block files in the `/dev` directory. The shell script does not take in any command line argument nor does it take any user input (through `read`). 

```bash
#! /bin/bash
echo -e "The number of block device files in the /dev directory is: \c"
ls -la /dev | grep ^b | wc -l
```

```bash
# Executing the shell script 
$ ./1-counting-block-files.sh
The number of block device files in the /dev directory is: 18

```

---

# Question 2

**[Question]** Write a shell program that checks the number of command line arguments and echoes an error message ifÂ there are not exactly three arguments or echoes the arguments themselves if there are three.Â 

**[Answer]** The shell script `2-cmd-line-args.sh` accepts command line arguments. It uses the `$#` variable to count the number of command line arguments passed to the script and then access the arguments passed to it using the `$@` variable. 

```bash
#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 3 ]
then
    echo "ERROR: More / less than 3 command line arguments were passed to this script!"
else
    args=("$@")
    echo "Argument 1: ${args[0]}"
    echo "Argument 2: ${args[1]}"
    echo "Argument 3: ${args[2]}"
fi
```

```bash
$ # Executing the shell script
$ # Output 1 - No errors
$ /2-cmd-line-args.sh a b c
Argument 1: a
Argument 2: b
Argument 3: c
$ # Output 2 - Error
$ ./2-cmd-line-args.sh 
ERROR: More / less than 3 command line arguments were passed to this script!
```

---

# Question 3

**[Question]** Write a shell program calledÂ `new_files`Â that will accept a variable number of command line arguments. TheÂ shell program will create a new file associated with each command line argument and echo a message thatÂ notifies the user as each file is created.Â 

**[Answer]** The script `3-create-new-files.sh` accepts the file names (with extension) as the command line arguments to the script. It uses the `touch` command to create the new files in the current working directory and echoes a message when each file is created. 

```bash
#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -gt 0 ]
then 
    file_names=("$@")
    for (( iter=0; iter<$#; iter++ ))
    do
        touch ${file_names[iter]}
        echo "The file ${file_names[iter]} has been created..."
    done
else 
    echo "Please provide file names as the argument to this script!"
fi
```

```bash
$ # Executing the shell script
$ # Output 1 - No errors
$ ./3-create-new-files.sh file1.txt file2.txt
The file file1.txt has been created...
The file file2.txt has been created...
$ # Output 2 - Error
$ ./3-create-new-files.sh 
Please provide file names as the argument to this script!
```

---

# Question 4

**[Question]** Create a directory called `.recyclebin`Â in your home directory. Write a shell program calledÂ `myrm`Â that will moveÂ all of the files you delete into the `.recyclebin`Â directory, your wastebasket. This is a useful tool which will allowÂ restoration of files after they have been removed. **Remember, the UNIX system has no undelete capability.**Â 

**[Answer]** The script `4-myrm.sh` accepts the names of the file(s) to be moved to the recycle bin (`~/.recyclebin`). The script creates this directory if it doesn't exist. 

```bash
#! /bin/bash
mkdir -p ~/.recyclebin 
if [ $# -gt 0 ]
then 
    files=("$@")
    for file in ${files[@]}
    do 
        if [ -e $file ]
        then 
            mv $file ~/.recyclebin
            echo "Your file $file have been moved to the recycle bin! You can find it in ~/.recyclebin"
        else 
            echo "The file $file doesn't exist!"
        fi 
    done
else
    echo "Please provide the file names to be deleted as the argument to this script!"
fi
```

```bash
$ # Creating a sample file for testing
$ touch file1 file2 file3 file4
$ # Executing the script
$ # Output 1
$ ./4-myrm.sh file1 file2 file3 file4
Your file file1 have been moved to the recycle bin! You can find them it in ~/.recyclebin
Your file file2 have been moved to the recycle bin! You can find them it in ~/.recyclebin
Your file file3 have been moved to the recycle bin! You can find them it in ~/.recyclebin
Your file file4 have been moved to the recycle bin! You can find them it in ~/.recyclebin
$ # Output 2 - Trying to delete a file that doesn't exist
$ ./4-myrm.sh filex
The file filex doesn't exist!
$ # Output 3 - No file names passed
$ ./4-myrm.sh 
Please provide the file names to be deleted as the argument to this script!

```

# Question 5

**[Question]** Write a script that uses `find` to look for a file and echo a suitable message if the file is not found. You must notÂ store the output of the find to a file.

**[Answer]** `5-find-file.sh`

```bash
#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -gt 0 ]
then 
    args=("$@")
    for (( iter=0; iter<$#; iter++))
    do 
        result=$(find ${args[iter]} 2> /dev/null)
        # The '2> /dev/null' is used to throw away the error message
        if [[ $result == ${args[iter]} ]]
        then 
            echo "File ${args[iter]} found!"
        else 
            echo "File ${args[iter]} not found!"
        fi
    done
else
    echo "Please pass the file names to be searched as the argument to this script!"
fi
```

```bash

$ # Executing the file
$ # Output 1
$ ./5-find-file.sh 4-myrm.sh 3-create-new-files.sh 
File 4-myrm.sh found!
File 3-create-new-files.sh found!
$ # Output 2
$ ./5-find-file.sh file1 file2
File file1 not found!
File file2 not found!
$ # Output 3 - No arguments passed
$ ./5-find-file.sh
Please pass the file names to be searched as the argument to this script!
```

# Question 6

**[Question]** Write a script which will give 4 choices to the user 

1. `ls` 

2.Â `pwd`

3. `who`

4. `exit` and execute the command asÂ per the users choice.

**[Answer]** The script `6-basic-command-choice.sh` does not accept any command line arguments but keeps asking the user to input their choice (using `read`) until they choose to exit. 

```bash
#! /bin/bash

echo "You have the following choices : "
echo "1. List the files in pwd - ls"
echo "2. Check your present working directory - pwd"
echo "3. Who are the users currently logged in - who"
echo "4. Exit this script"

echo -e "Enter your choice: \c"
read user_choice

while [ $user_choice -ne 4 ]
do 
    echo 
    case $user_choice in 
        1) 
            echo "=================ls=================="

# Question 8

**[Question]** Write shell script that takes a login name as command â€“ line argument and reports when that person logged in. 

**[Answer]** The script `8-user-logged-in.sh` accepts the name of user as the command line argument and uses the `w` and `grep` command to find if the user is logged in.

```bash
#! /bin/bash

username=$1
search_result=$(w -h | grep -w ^$username)
if [ `expr length "$search_result"` -gt 0 ]
then
    logged_in_at=$(echo $search_result | awk '{print $4}')
    echo "The user $username has logged in at $logged_in_at"
else 
    echo "User not found / isn't logged in"
fi
```

```bash
$ # Executing the script
$ # Output 1
$ ./8-user-logged-in.sh shathin
The user shathin has logged in at 09:28
$ # Output 2
$ ./8-user-logged-in.sh ryu
User not found / isn't logged in

# Question 10

**[Question]** Write a script toÂ backupÂ a given directory to a given file name in your home directory. Both, the directoryÂ name and the backup fileÂ has toÂ be passed as command line input. Design the script with suitable exceptionÂ handling.

**[Answer]** The script `10-backup.sh` uses the `tar` and `gzip` commands for archiving and compressing the directory. It then moves this to the home directory. The name of the directory to be backed up is passed as the command line arguement to the script followed by the name of the backup file.

```jsx
#! /bin/bash

dir_to_backup=$1
backup_file=$2

if [ $# -eq 2 ] 
then
    tar -cf ~/$backup_file.tar $dir_to_backup
    gzip ~/$backup_file.tar
else 
    echo "Invalid number of command line arguements. You need to specify <file_to_backup> & <backup_file> names (in that order)"
fi
```

```bash
$ # Executing the script
$ ./10-backup.sh . lss

# Question 11

**[Question]** Write a script to check how much space is used by each directory of a given file system. The name of the fileÂ systemÂ has toÂ be provided from the command line parameter.Â 

**[Answer]** The script `11-space-used-by-dir.sh` uses the `findmnt` and `du` command to get the amount of space used by each directory in the file system. The name of the filesystem like `/dev/sda4` is passed as the command line argument to the script.

```bash
#! /bin/bash

file_system=$1
mount=$(findmnt -o TARGET -n $file_system)
if [ `expr length "$mount"` -gt 0 ]
then 
	  du -c -s -h $mount 2> /dev/null
else 
    echo "File system not found. Make sure it exists and that you've written the correct name (ex: /dev/sda4)"
fi
```

```bash
$ # Executing
$ ./11-space-used-by-dir.sh /dev/sda3
MOUNT : /
84G     /
84G     total

7. Insert a given string at the end of each line - The script `15g.sh` accepts the string to append and file name (in that order).
    
    ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    
    string=$1
    file=$2
    echo "$(sed 's/$/'$string' /' $file)"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    $ # Executing the script
    $ ./15g.sh dd example
    This is the first line of an example text.dd 
    It is a text with erors.dd 
    Lots of erors.dd 
    So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.dd 
    This is a line not containing any errors.dd 
    This is the last line.dd
    ```
