# Linux Shell Scripting - IIIT, Bengaluru

### Introduction

This repository contains notes and resources for the Linux Shell Scripting course, which was part of my coursework during the Preparatory Term of my M.Tech program at IIIT Bangalore in August 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Thangaraju B., whose insightful teaching laid the foundation for my understanding of Linux shell scripting.

### Motivation

Originally, these notes were compiled on my [Notion page](https://shathin.notion.site/Linux-Shell-Scripting-0c791a8ae0514353bc7b17d7b2d1b426?pvs=74), but I am now migrating them to GitHub. This move aims to open up the content for collaboration from new students and to share this resource with a broader audience. By making this knowledge more accessible, I hope to contribute to the learning journey of others who are exploring Linux shell scripting.

### Disclaimer

Please note that the content might not be complete as it was created during my time in the M.Tech program, and I havenâ€™t actively maintained it since. Therefore, it is open for collaboration from other students of IIIT, Bengaluru who are interested in contributing to and expanding the content.
